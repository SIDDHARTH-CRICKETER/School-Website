In case the child suffers from any medical ailment or illness, parents are requested to give detailed instructions regarding first aid for any special medical problems e.g. diabetes, asthma or allergies. The students receiving transient or long-term medical treatment are requested to discuss this with the school Doctor prior to attending school and the appropriate information should be documented on the medical form. Self-medication will not be allowed. At SIS every student and staff is covered under a Medical Insurance from the date of joining the School and we conduct Annual Health Check-ups for students and staff by Symbiosis Centre for Healthcare, Pune. </p>

All our food is freshly prepared on-site to provide the highest nutritional value. This also allows us to meet a range of dietary requirements. Each day the school receives delivery of locally-sourced, healthy organic produce. Our menu also changes daily, so students experience a range of foods that will fulfil their nutritional needs whilst at school. This includes breakfast in the morning, lunch in the afternoon and evening snacks. We believe that great food promotes motivation and focus for better learning. The monthly food menu is shared with the parents through our school software. </p>

Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

     <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >1. Accuracy
Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
<br>
2. Economics
Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
<br>
3. Productivity / Efficiency
Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
